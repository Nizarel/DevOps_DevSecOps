Epic,DevSecOps,,,,New,"This Epic, as created by CSE Core DevOps' packaged sprint, is meant to guide engineers through adding DevSecOps practices to their workflow. In some scenarios third party tooling is required in order to achieve the scenario. We have tried many tools out in these scenarios and our selected tools are simply a recommendation but typically the scenario can be fulfilled with a variety of tools that offer similar functionality and capabilities.",This Epic can be considered complete once the engineering team has create all of the appropriate tooling as decided by the development team. This epic is meant to be suggestive of good DevSecOps practices and depending on the specifics of the project all of the Features will not be a good fit.
