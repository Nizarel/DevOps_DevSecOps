# Penetration Testing in Azure Devops

Penetration testing is a vital part of defensive security that can help to identify vulnerabilities and plan mitigation efforts. By shifting parts of this effort into the Dev(Sec)Ops, Pipeline teams can prevent many vulnerabilities from getting beyond the developer's arena, thereby ensuring more reliable and better performant systems with less downtime and easier maintenance.

> For successful implementation of any security policy, any separation between Security & Engineering Teams must be bridged, which is facilitated by a good workflow, robust communication pathways, and willingness for both teams to support the success of the project as a whole. The following discussion on shifting pen-tests left should be applied in conjunction with continued improvements to the structure of that bridge. The goal is to get quick feedback into the developer's hands to release functional, secure software.
