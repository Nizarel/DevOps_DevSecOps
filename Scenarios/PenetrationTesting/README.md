# Penetration Testing in Azure Devops

Penetration testing is a vital part of defensive securirty that can help to identify vulnerabilities and plan mitigation efforts. By shifting parts of this effort into the DevOps Pipeline teams can prevent many vulnerabilities from getting beyond the developers arena thereby insuring more reliable and better performant systems with less downtime and easier maintenance.

> For successful implementation of any security policy it is vital that any seperation between Security & Engineering Teams be bridged which is facilitated by a good workflow, solid communication pathways, and willingness for both teams to support the success of the project as a whole. The following discussion on shifting pen-tests left should be applied in conjunction with continued improvements to the structure of that bridge. The goal is to get quick feedback into the developers hands to release good, secure software.
