## When a Customer Needs More Security

If a customer requires more attentiveness to security than CSE can currently provide, CELA recommends the customer engage their current account manager. This can begin a Premier Support agreement or add a security verification to an existing agreement.

**Some situations where this might be necessary:**

* Customer requests that CSE provide any sort of guarantee or promise of security in the application
* Customer is requesting advanced guidance around security design
* Customer is an FSI/HSI customer requiring formalized validation documents
* Customer requires a security-focused design that is not already documented in existing written scenarios
* Customer is developing an application that requires protection from state actors
